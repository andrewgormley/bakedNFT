wtfTitle: WTF is an NFT?
wtfColumn1Title: WHAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY?
wtfColumn1Copy: |
  NFTs are exploding. And, importantly, they're gaining more mainstream relevance. The rapid growth in interest in NFTs is built upon the first layer of the web, the internet, and the second layer, social media. We see the blockchain and NFTs as the third, emerging layer of modern consumer technology.

  Interest in NFTs is largely driven by the youngest age demographics. They allow direct engagement and co-creation with content creators, inspiring consumers with purpose & scaling consumer participation and engagement.

  NFTs can complement both a digital and physical consumer journey. The culture is driven by drops and collaborations, which enables brands to create a launch culture of collaborations and dedicated product capsules to drive meaningful energy.
wtfColumn2Title: WHY DO WE EXIST?
wtfColumn2Copy: |
  Creators and brands are rushing to be first in the NFT space, but a lack of knowledge is leading to the market being flooded with low quality, poorly executed launches.

  We exist to bridge the gap. We are a long-term partner for creators and brands who see NFTs through the lens of an opportunity to deliver value to their consumers over the net 50 years.

    title: OUR BELIEF
    copy: |
      99% of current NFT projects will be worth nothing over the coming years. They are built on dangerously short-term thinking. We are thinking dramatically more long-term. NFT projects we collaborate on must have a vision to give consumers value, using the technology as gateway to building brand value.
